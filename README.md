# Pipelined ARM implementation
### Luke Zambella and Evan Rahimi
----
Verilog implementation of a basic ARM processor with a 5-stage pipeline using only 7 instructions.

#### Running
To run this, icarus verilog is needed. A simulation build can be assembled by running `iverilog -o [OUTPUT FILE] *.v` and simulated through `vvp [OUTPUT FILE]`. By defult, it outputs a waveform of every single wire as `dump.vcd`

This implementation only contains the following LEGv8 instructions:
|Assembly shorthand|Binary OpCode|
|------------------|-------------|
| ADD | `10001011000`|
| SUB | `11001011000`|
| AND | `10001010000`|
| ORR | `10101010000`|
| LDUR| `11111000010`|
|STUR | `11111000000`|
| CBZ | `10110100000`|

The ROM file is a verilog file `ROM.v` where the main program can be defined. The default program loads a predefined value from `DATA_MEM[0]` and `DATA_MEM[1]` and stores it into a register where it is added. Data hazards have not been added yet so it performs some ALU operations in the meantime while the data gets safely stored into the register.
